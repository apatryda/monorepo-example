// Welcome to your schema
//   Schema driven development is Keystone's modus operandi
//
// This file is where we define the lists, fields and hooks for our data.
// If you want to learn more about how lists are configured, please read
// - https://keystonejs.com/docs/config/lists

import { list } from '@keystone-6/core'
import { allowAll } from '@keystone-6/core/access'

// see https://keystonejs.com/docs/fields/overview for the full list of fields
//   this is a few common fields for an example
import { text, relationship, password, timestamp } from '@keystone-6/core/fields'

// the document field is a more complicated field, so it has it's own package
import { document } from '@keystone-6/fields-document'
// if you want to make your own fields, see https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/custom-fields

// when using Typescript, you can refine your types to a stricter subset by importing
// the generated types from './generated/keystone/types'
import type { Lists } from './generated/keystone/types'
